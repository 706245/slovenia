    <h1>History of Slovenia national team in the EUROS</h1>
    <h3>Golden generation (1998–2002)</h3>
    <h4>UEFA Euro 2000 campaign</h4>
    <p>
        In July 1998, Srečko Katanec was appointed as the new manager of the team. Under his guidance, Slovenia finished the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers in second place, only behind Norway. Zlatko Zahovič scored eight of Slovenia's twelve goals in the qualifiers. In the additional play-offs, Slovenia faced Ukraine. The first leg was played in Ljubljana, which Slovenia won 2–1 after trailing 1–0. Zahovič scored Slovenia's first goal, and Milenko Ačimovič scored a goal from the halfway line late in the match to make the score 2–1. The second match was played in snowy conditions in Kyiv. Serhii Rebrov scored from the penalty spot in the 68th minute to give Ukraine a lead, while Slovenia equalised eight minutes later with a goal by Miran Pavlin. The 1–1 draw meant that Slovenia won 3–2 on aggregate and qualified for its first major tournament.

        <p>Slovenia's lineup for their first ever game at a major tournament, against FR Yugoslavia at UEFA Euro 2000.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        At Euro 2000, Slovenia were drawn into Group C, together with Spain, FR Yugoslavia and Norway. In the first game, Slovenia played against Yugoslavia and took a 3–0 lead after one hour of play, with Zahovič scoring twice and Pavlin once. However, Yugoslavia made a comeback as they scored three goals in just six minutes for a 3–3 draw, despite playing with only ten players after Siniša Mihajlović was sent off. The second game against Spain was played in Amsterdam. Spain took a 1–0 lead with a goal by Raúl, but Slovenia equalised after one hour of play as Zahovič scored his third goal of the tournament. Just a minute later, Spain were leading again as Joseba Etxeberria scored the winning goal. In the last match of the group stage, Slovenia played against Norway and still had a chance to progress to the quarterfinals. The match finished in a goalless draw and Slovenia won its second point of the tournament, but were eliminated.

    <h3>Kek's second spell, Nations League promotion, and Euro 2024 (2019–present)</h3>

    <p>Kek was appointed as the manager for the second time in November 2018. Slovenia failed to make a breakthrough during the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, losing both games against Austria and obtaining only one point against North Macedonia. Despite the unexpected 2–0 home victory against Poland, Slovenia finished fourth in the group. However, in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League C, Slovenia remained undefeated in all six games against Greece, Moldova and Kosovo. Under the leadership of team captain Jan Oblak, Slovenia held Greece to a 0–0 draw in both matches and also obtained all twelve available points against Moldova and Kosovo, thus securing first place in the group and promotion to League B for the 2022–23 edition. In the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, Slovenia once again failed to qualify for the main event; they started the campaign with a 1–0 home victory against Croatia with a goal by Sandi Lovrić, which was Slovenia's first victory over their neighbours after failing to beat them in the previous eight official matches. After two narrow defeats against Russia and a surprising defeat to Cyprus, Slovenia finished fourth in the group with four wins in ten matches, behind Croatia, Russia and Slovakia.</p>

    <p>In 2022, Slovenia made their maiden appearance in League B of the Nations League, and avoided relegation after finishing third in a group with Serbia, Norway and Sweden. Benjamin Šeško scored three of Slovenia's six goals in the competition, including a goal in the decisive 1–1 away draw to Sweden that secured a crucial point on the last matchday.</p>

    <p>In the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers, Slovenia finally ended its major tournament drought and qualified for the Euro finals for the first time in 24 years. Šeško was once again one of the key players, scoring five goals in nine appearances, including a goal in the decisive home game against Kazakhstan on the final matchday, which Slovenia won 2–1 in front of 16,432 spectators, a record home attendance for the Slovenia national team. The team finished the qualifiers in second place, behind only Denmark, with a record tally of 22 points from 10 games. In addition, it was also the first time that Slovenia directly qualified for a major tournament without having to play an additional play-off.</p>

    <p>At the Euro finals in Germany, Slovenia advanced from the group stage for the first time at a major tournament after drawing all three matches in their group against Denmark, Serbia and England, before being eliminated in the round of 16 on penalties by Portugal, finishing the tournament undefeated after regular time.</p>
<br><br>
    <h3>Home Stadium</h3>
    <p>Slovenia's home matches have been held at ten venues in eight cities. Since 2010, most matches have been played in Ljubljana at the Stožice Stadium, with a seating capacity of 16,038. The final training sessions and physical preparation of the team before domestic matches are held at the National Football Centre Brdo in Predoslje.</p>

    <p>Stožice Stadium, the main stadium of the Slovenia national team</p>
    </div>
     <p>The first home stadium of Slovenia was the Bežigrad Stadium, located in the Bežigrad District in Ljubljana. It was the main stadium of the national team until 2004, when UEFA banned it due to insufficient infrastructure. In the same year, the newly built Arena Petrol in Celje became the new main venue of the team for the next three years. For the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Slovenia moved to the recently renovated Ljudski vrt stadium in Maribor, where the team remained undefeated in their six home matches during the qualifying campaign (five wins and a draw), consequently qualifying for the main tournament. Stožice were built in 2010, and since then the venue has hosted most of the national team's home matches. The venue also holds the record for the highest home attendance of the Slovenia national team, as 16,432 spectators gathered for the final match of the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Kazakhstan on 20 November 2023, which saw Slovenia qualify for the Euros. The attendance record was later equaled in March 2024, when Slovenia defeated Portugal in a friendly match, ending their eleven-game winning streak.</p>
